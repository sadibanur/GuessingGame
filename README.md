# GuessingGame

 I have created “GuessingGame” webpage that allows a user to play a guessing game against the computer. The program should use a graphical user interface (GUI). The user should be prompted with an invitation to guess a number between 1 and 20 and after each guess should be told if they are too high or too low. When the number is finally guessed the user should be asked if they want to play again.
